On a more immediate time-frame McCain called for the use of NATO air-power to establish a no-fly zone and the use of intelligence assets to gather evidence of genocide and build cases against its perpetrators.[104],In a December 2005 Washington Post opinion column  and at the Save Darfur rally in April 2006  Obama called for more assertive action to oppose genocide in the Darfur region of Sudan.[105] He has divested $180.000 in personal holdings of Sudan-related stock  and has urged divestment from companies doing business in Iran.[106]
