Bidule,Mac OS X  Windows,C++,C++,ASIO/ CoreAudio (Mac)/ ReWire support. Possible to write custom modules via API if NDA accepted.
ChucK,Mac OS X  Linux  Windows,C++,[empty],Unified timing mechanism (no separation between audio-rate and control-rate)  command-line access
Csound,Mac OS X  Linux  Windows,C  C++,C; also Python  Java  Lisp  Lua  Tcl  C++,IDE (QuteCsound)  multitrack interface (blue); several analysis/resynthesis facilities; can compute double-precision audio; Python and LuaJIT algorithmic composition library; multi-threaded processing
Impromptu,Mac OS X,Lisp  Objective-C  Scheme,C  C++  Objective-C  Scheme,Native access to most OS X APIs including Core Image  Quartz  QuickTime and OpenGL. Impromptu also includes its own statically typed (inferencing) systems language for heavy numeric processing - OpenGL  RT AudioDSP etc..
Kyma,Mac OS X  Windows,Smalltalk  C  Objective-C,Smalltalk,The Kyma hardware processes user algorithms at sample-rate  as opposed to a vector of samples[1] Kyma has a Frequency resolution of .0026 Hz  and large multi-dimensional arrays can be transferred through spectral algorithms at the speed of a single Frame.
