John McCain,Barack Obama
McCain maintains a relatively moderate stance concerning Pakistan  although he has recognized the South Asian nation as an important part of US Foreign Policy. In the aftermath of Pakistan's former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's assassination (in December 2007) McCain appeared to rule out the option of US forces entering Pakistan  saying that it was not an appropriate time to "threaten" Pakistan.[116],On August 1  2007  Obama declared in a foreign policy speech that the United States must be willing to strike al Qaeda targets inside Pakistan  with or without the consent of the Pakistani government. He claimed that if elected  "If we have actionable intelligence about high value terrorist targets and President Musharraf won't act  we will".[117]
