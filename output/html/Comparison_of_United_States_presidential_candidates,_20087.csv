John McCain,Barack Obama
While McCain historically favored deficit reduction over tax cuts [42][43] he has pledged not to rescind recent tax cuts in combination with reduced spending.[44][45][46] McCain believes that lower taxes will stimulate the economy  and that the current deficit owes more to overspending than to tax cuts.[47] McCain plans to balance the budget by the end of his first term.[45] According to the Tax Policy Center  McCain's tax plans (by extending the Bush tax cuts and cutting corporate tax rates from 35% to 25% to increase investment  among other measures)  would increase the national debt by nearly $5 trillion over 10 years  a nearly 50% increase.[37],Obama advocates responding to the "precarious budget situation" by eliminating "tax credits that have outlived their usefulness"  closing corporate tax loopholes  and restoring the PAYGO policy that prohibits increases in federal spending without a way to compensate for the lost revenue.[48] Obama proposes extending the Bush tax cuts for low- and middle-income families  while letting taxes go back up for individuals earning over $200.000 or couples earning over $250.000.
Chuck Baldwin,Bob Barr
Baldwin would work to repeal the Sixteenth Amendment (income tax)  inheritance taxes  and property taxes. "We are bankrupting our country with this incessant and burdensome tax system."[31],Barr supports repealing the Sixteenth Amendment and mentions the Fair Tax as a possible alternative. "Meaningful tax reform begins with reining in government spending."[49]
