John McCain,Barack Obama
In a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee on April 23  2002  McCain said that "no American leader should be expected to sell a false peace to our ally  consider Israel's right to self-defense less legitimate than ours  or insist that Israel negotiate a political settlement while terrorism remains the Palestinians' preferred bargaining tool."[84],Obama supports a two-state solution.[85] Referring to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in January 2006  Obama denounced Hamas while praising former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. At a meeting with then Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom on the eve of Hamas' sweeping election victory [86] Obama stated that Sharon's role in the conflict had always been "absolutely important and constructive."[citation needed]
