John McCain,Barack Obama
In June 1999  McCain said "The only way to increase the yield on Social Security dollars is by allowing workers to make investment decisions for themselves; by empowering American families to invest  in most robust portfolios  a portion of their earnings for Social Security that they would otherwise pay in taxes to Social Security."[52] In January 2000  he repeated his strong support for creating private Social Security accounts.[53] Partial privatization  or diverting payroll taxes to private accounts  would reduce available funds for current retirees significantly  requiring large debt increases to cover the transition.[54],Obama has said that Social Security's funding problem is "real but manageable." He has proposed to fund Social Security by applying payroll taxes to individual income above $250.000 per year  and says that these high-income earners should "pay their fair share." When asked if he would consider raising the retirement age or cutting benefits  Obama did not rule these approaches out entirely  saying  "everything should be on the table." However  he has said that he would not push for either of those approaches  and says that an increase in tax revenue is necessary to stabilize the system. Obama opposes adding personal accounts to Social Security.[55]
