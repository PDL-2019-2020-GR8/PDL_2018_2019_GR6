That month  the U.S. Senate voted 90–9 to support the amendment.[119] In October 2007  McCain said of waterboarding that  "They [other presidential candidates] should know what it is. It is not a complicated procedure. It is torture."[120] However  in February 2008 he voted against HR 2082  the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008  which included provisions that would have prevented the CIA from waterboarding prisoners.,Obama voted against the Military Commissions Act of 2006[121] and later voted to restore habeas corpus to those detained by the U.S. (which had been stripped by the Military Commissions Act).[122] He has advocated closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp  but has not supported two specific bills that would have done so.[123] Obama opposes the use of torture.[124]
