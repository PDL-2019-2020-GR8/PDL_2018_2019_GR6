John McCain,Barack Obama
John McCain called the crisis with Iran "the most serious crisis we have faced – outside of the entire war on terror – since the end of the Cold War." "Nuclear capability in Iran is unacceptable " said McCain. McCain criticized Russia and China for causing "gridlock" in the UN Security Council and preventing the sanctioning of Iran as well as other areas of conflict such as Darfur and Burma. If elected  McCain pledges to create a "league of democracies" with the purpose of addressing those conflicts without the approval of China and Russia.[99][100],Obama stated he regards Iran's government as "a threat to all of us " stating that the US "should take no option  including military action  off the table. Sustained and aggressive diplomacy combined with tough sanctions should be our primary means to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons."[101]
