John McCain,Barack Obama
McCain gave a major speech on his energy policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He connected energy independence with national security  climate change  and the environment.[148][149] McCain proposed increasing ethanol imports[citation needed] and moving from exploration to production of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. He said that US dependence on foreign oil is "a major strategic vulnerability  a serious threat to our security  our economy and the well being of our planet." He is co-sponsor of a Senate cap-and-trade bill designed to limit greenhouse gas emissions [150] and is seen as a bipartisan leader on the issue. McCain supports the increased use of nuclear energy in the US and reduce renewable sources to produce electricity. He has promoted the expanded use of nuclear power  calling for 45 new nuclear reactors to be built by 2030.[151],Obama has presented a 'New Energy for America' plan to achieve a low carbon economy  subsidizing 5 million new green jobs.[140] He proposes $150 billion over 10 years to accelerate the commercialization of plug-in hybrids  promote development of commercial scale renewable energy (establishing a 100% federal RPS to require that 10 percent of electricity be derived from renewable sources by 2012 and 25% in 2025[141])  encourage energy efficiency  advance the next generation of biofuels (requiring 60 billion US gallons (230.000.000 m3) by 2030) and fuel infrastructure  and begin transition to a new digital electricity grid (smart metering  demand response  distributed generation and electricity storage systems).[140] He also plans to reduce overall U.S. oil consumption by at least 35%  or 10 million barrels (1.600.000 m3) per day  by 2030 to offset imports from OPEC nations.[152][153] Obama and other Senators introduced the BioFuels Security Act in 2006. Regarding the domestic use of nuclear power  Obama declared himself flatly opposed to building a nuclear waste repository in Nevada and has called for the facility's closure.[154] However  Obama voted for the Energy Policy Act of 2005  which allocated $4.3 billion in tax credits to the nuclear energy sector.[155][156] Obama and other Senators introduced a bill in 2007 to promote the development of commercially viable plug-in hybrids and other electric-drive vehicles in order to shift away from petroleum fuels and "toward much cleaner – and cheaper – electricity for transportation".[157] In his plan  related with transportation  he proposes increase fuel economy standards 4 percent per each year  specific focus on R&D in advanced battery technology and a $7.000 tax credit for the purchase of advanced technology vehicles as well as conversion tax credits and $4 billion retooling tax credits and loan guarantees for domestic auto plants and parts manufacturers; the entire White House fleet would be converted to plug-ins and half of cars purchased by the federal government will be plug-in (hybrids or all-electric) vehicles by 2012.[140]
Chuck Baldwin,Bob Barr
Would dissolve the Department of Energy. Believes in American energy independence by repealing prohibitions on domestic oil drilling  oil refineries  and nuclear plants.[31],Says the free market needs to be the foundation of the United States' energy policy. Supports drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.[158]
