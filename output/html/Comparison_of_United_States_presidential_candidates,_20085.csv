John McCain,Barack Obama
McCain is a strong proponent of free trade.[29] He supports the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)  the existing General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  and U.S. participation in the World Trade Organization (WTO).[29] He opposes including labor and environmental conditions to trade agreements.[29],Obama supports expanding trade only if the United States' trade partners place labor and environmental standards on their industries to "level the playing field" for American interests. If elected President  Obama plans to renegotiate NAFTA to include stricter labor and environmental standards for Canada and Mexico. He has criticized the current agreement for not including such standards  and he also voted against and criticized the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) for similar reasons.[30]
Chuck Baldwin,Bob Barr
Baldwin would lead the US out of the North American and the Central America Free Trade Agreements.[31] He would impose a revenue tariff.[32],Barr's campaign site states that America "should encourage private involvement around the world  particularly through free trade. The most effective way to preserve peace is through an expanding free market  backed by a full range of cultural and other private relationships".[33]
