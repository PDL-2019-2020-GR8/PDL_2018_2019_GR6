Key,State,Notes
[empty],Alabama,The Alabama State Senate allows a filibuster  and has a general three-fifths requirement to enact cloture. A simple majority of 18 is acceptable when dealing with the budget and redistricting.<ref></ref>
[empty],Arkansas,Arkansas  along with Rhode Island  is one of the only states that requires a supermajority to pass a budget. A three-fourths majority is required for appropriations  except for education  highways  and paying down the state debt  which require a simple majority.<ref name="ncsl.org">http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/budget/supermajority-vote-requirements-to-pass-the-budget.aspx</ref>
[empty],California,From 1933-2011 there was a two-thirds requirement for general fund appropriations for purposes other than public schools (Const.  Art. IV  Sec. 12). Because the Legislature typically passes one main budget bill  the requirement effectively applied to the whole budget bill.<ref name="ncsl.org"/> There has been a two-thirds requirement for tax increases since Proposition 13 in 1978. In 2010  voters approved Proposition 25  eliminating the 2/3 requirement for the budget  but keeping it for tax increases.
