Notes on the Java implementation <kbd>FilesreadAllLines</kbd> method returns a List of String  with the content of the text file  Files has also the method <kbd>readAllBytes</kbd>  returns an array of <kbd>Strings</kbd> <kbd>Fileswrite</kbd> method writes byte array or into an output file  indicated by a Path object <kbd>Fileswrite</kbd> method also takes care of buffering and closing the output stream,Notes on the C# implementation The <kbd>ReadLines</kbd> method returns an enumerable object that upon enumeration will read the file one line at a time The <kbd>WriteAllLines</kbd> method takes an enumerable and retrieves a line at a time and writes it until the enumeration ends The underlying reader will automatically allocate a buffer  thus there is no need to explicitly introduce a buffered stream <kbd>WriteAllLines</kbd> automatically closes the output stream  also in the case of an abnormal termination
